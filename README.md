# Personal Fitness Trainer

## Vision Statement

The Personal Fitness Trainer will be an app that helps people plan their fitness activities, set fitness goals for themselves and keep a record of their personal fitness. Personal recommendations for activities will be given to the user, which will be tailored to helping them meet their fitness goals.  
One group the app is targeted towards, is people with busy schedules who might have trouble setting aside time for exercise. The app will have an activity planner where users can plan on times to exercise, and what type of exercise to perform. The recommendations given by the app for fitness activities will also save the user’s time if they are unsure what type of exercise is best for them, and they do not have time to research it. These recommendations will also be useful to users who do not know a lot about fitness, and may not be motivated to spend time researching it.  
Several features will be used to provide better exercise recommendations to the user, and help them achieve their goals. The user will be able to set up a personal profile, where they can enter in information such as age, height and weight. To cater to as many users as possible, the user profile will let them enter a personal goal, such as a target weight, a target amount of reps or sets of an exercise they can perform, or how long of a distance they can run. These goals, and the other information on their profile, will influence the types of exercise recommended to the user.  
A record of the user’s past activities will be kept, so previous fitness plans will still be accessible. There will also be a fitness diary for users to log information relevant to their goals and schedule. Information from the diary will be presented along with the fitness record, to help the user view how well they are meeting their short-term goals. For example, if a user has an activity planned at a certain time every week, and they frequently report in the diary that they were not able to complete it, viewing these pieces of information together may help them decide to change their plans in the future.  
To help users stay motivated and get a clearer picture of their progress, the app will provide progress reports that show collected data over a period of time. This will include compilations of data entered by the user, such as a graph of their weight over time or how far they have been able to run each day, as well as data calculated by the app such as body mass index or an estimate of how many calories the user has burned.  

## Success Criteria

To determine if the project is successful, users will be asked to participate in a survey. The project will be considered successful if:
1. The majority of users who primarily started using the app to plan their fitness activities around their schedule agree that the app accomplished this, and that they exercise more now than they did before using the app.
2. The majority of users who started using the app primarily to get exercise recommendations tailored to their fitness goals agree that the recommendations have been right for them, and that they have made significant progress towards those goals.
3. The majority of users agree that the information presented to them by the app has:
    - Helped them understand how much progress they have made towards their goals (if any were set).
    - Helped identify which parts of their plans worked for them and which did not.
    - Helped adjust their plans and/or goals to something that works better for them, if such adjustments were needed.
